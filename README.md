# Hardware Savings Calculator

This repository contains a small, static web app that helps compare two hardware strategies for AI-enabled video systems:

- Buying smart / Edge AI cameras for every location
- Using Sighthound Compute Hardware with standard IP cameras

The calculator is intended for external, customer-facing use. It is often used in sales conversations, demos, and follow-up emails where we need to show hardware cost tradeoffs clearly and honestly.

The primary problem it solves is making it easy to compare hardware capital costs between these two approaches without asking the user to understand our product in depth.

---

## 1) Project overview

### What this calculator does

At a high level, the calculator:

- Takes a camera count and two price points (smart AI camera vs standard IP camera)
- Estimates how many Sighthound Compute Nodes are required
- Compares total hardware cost of:
  - "Today" (smart AI cameras everywhere)
  - "With Sighthound" (Compute Nodes + standard IP cameras)
- Shows savings (or extra cost), percent reduction, and cost per camera

All results are based on fixed, documented assumptions about hardware capacity and pricing (see below).

### Who it is for

- Prospects and customers evaluating Sighthound hardware
- Channel partners who need a simple way to explain edge compute economics
- Sighthound sales and SEs who want a quick, visual cost story in meetings

This is **public-facing**: copy and behavior should be safe to put in front of customers as-is.

### What problem it solves

Buying smart AI cameras for every location pushes AI compute into each device, which is often expensive and inflexible. Sighthound’s approach centralizes AI compute into a dedicated node that can serve multiple standard IP cameras.

The calculator answers: *“If we move compute into a Sighthound node instead of buying smart cameras, how does our upfront hardware spend change?”*

---

## 2) Core concept

The tool compares two concrete hardware architectures:

### a) Smart / Edge AI cameras

- Each camera contains its own AI compute
- You buy as many smart cameras as you have camera channels
- Total cost scales linearly with camera count and smart camera price

### b) Sighthound Compute Node + standard IP cameras

- AI compute lives in a dedicated **Sighthound Compute Node**
- Each Compute Node can handle multiple standard IP cameras
- Cameras themselves are simpler and cheaper

**Important:** existing standard IP cameras can usually be **reused**. As long as they are compatible, there is **no rip-and-replace requirement** for every camera. The UI includes a toggle for "we already have standard IP cameras" to make this reuse explicit in the math.

---

## 3) Key assumptions (conceptual)

These assumptions are intentional and should not be changed casually. They are encoded in constants and unit tests.

- **Capacity:** Each Sighthound Compute Node supports **up to 4 cameras**
- **Node price:** Each Compute Node is fixed at **$3,500**
- **Scope:** The calculator is **hardware-only**
  - No SaaS, licensing, or cloud subscription fees in the core totals
  - No bandwidth, storage, or retention assumptions
  - No labor, installation, or ongoing operations
- **Audience:** This is a pre-sales estimation tool, not a full TCO/ROI model

If you need to change any of these (for example, if hardware pricing changes), update the constants in code **and** keep this section in sync so the behavior remains transparent.

---

## 4) Calculator logic

### Core formulas

The core math is deliberately simple and should stay that way.

Given:

- `totalCameras` – total camera channels in the deployment
- `smartCameraCost` – hardware price per smart AI camera
- `dumbCameraCost` – hardware price per standard IP camera

The calculator computes:

1. **Compute Nodes required**

   ```
   nodesNeeded = ceil(totalCameras / 4)
   ```

   - We use `ceil()` (round up) because you cannot buy a fraction of a Compute Node.
   - If you have 5–8 cameras, you still need 2 nodes; 9–12 cameras require 3 nodes, etc.

2. **Current (smart camera) total cost**

   ```
   currentTotal = totalCameras × smartCameraCost
   ```

3. **Sighthound hardware total (new deployment)**

   ```
   sighthoundTotal = nodesNeeded × 3500 + totalCameras × dumbCameraCost
   ```

   This is the base case where you are buying both the Compute Nodes and the standard IP cameras.

4. **Savings (or extra cost)**

   ```
   savings = currentTotal − sighthoundTotal
   ```

5. **Percent reduction**

   ```
   percentReduction = (savings / currentTotal) × 100
   ```

6. **Cost per camera (before and after)**

   ```
   costPerCameraBefore = currentTotal / totalCameras
   costPerCameraAfter  = sighthoundTotal / totalCameras
   ```

7. **Optional software comparison (monthly)**

   If the user provides a current software cost per camera per month, we also compute an optional monthly software comparison. This is **not** included in any of the hardware totals or savings numbers; it is surfaced as a separate, clearly labeled section in the UI.

   ```
   if currentSoftwarePerCamera is provided:
     softwareCurrentMonthly   = totalCameras × currentSoftwarePerCamera
     softwareSighthoundMonthly = totalCameras × SIGHTHOUND_SOFTWARE_COST_PER_CAMERA
     softwareDeltaMonthly      = softwareCurrentMonthly − softwareSighthoundMonthly
   else:
     softwareCurrentMonthly   = null
     softwareSighthoundMonthly = null
     softwareDeltaMonthly      = null
   ```

   - When the inputs are valid, the UI reveals a small "Software costs (monthly, optional estimate)" section.
   - The "Monthly software difference" line is colored and labeled as either **savings** (green, negative delta) or **extra cost** (red, positive delta).
   - When no software cost per camera is entered, the entire software comparison section remains hidden, to keep the default view focused on hardware only.

### Existing camera toggle

In the UI there is a toggle for **“We already have standard IP cameras installed in this system.”** When this is checked:

- We still compute `nodesNeeded` the same way.
- The camera hardware component in the Sighthound total becomes zero:
  - Sighthound only charges for Compute Nodes in that scenario.
- The helper text under the toggle changes to make it explicit that existing IP cameras are being reused and that no new camera hardware cost is added on the Sighthound side.

Conceptually:

``` 
if existingCameras:
  sighthoundCameraHardwareTotal = 0
else:
  sighthoundCameraHardwareTotal = totalCameras × dumbCameraCost

sighthoundTotal = nodesNeeded × 3500 + sighthoundCameraHardwareTotal
```

### Why negative savings are still shown

The calculator always shows the result, even when `savings` is negative (i.e., Sighthound hardware costs more than the smart camera baseline for a given scenario).

- This is **intentional**: the tool is for honest comparison, not only “good” examples.
- In the UI, negative savings are labeled as **“Extra cost vs today”** and styled in red; positive savings are labeled as **“Savings vs today”** and styled in green.
- The primary savings card background also changes (neutral/positive gradient vs subtle warning tint) so the overall state of the scenario is visually clear.
- This avoids misleading users into thinking Sighthound is *always* cheaper on hardware alone.

## 5) UX design decisions

### Two-column layout

On larger screens, the calculator uses a two-column layout:

- **Left column:** inputs (camera count, smart camera cost, IP camera cost)
- **Right column:** calculated results

Reasons:

- Keeps cause (inputs) and effect (results) visible side by side
- Reduces scrolling in demos and screen shares
- Matches common “form on the left, summary on the right” mental model

On smaller screens the layout stacks, but the source order is unchanged: inputs first, then results.

### Result ordering

Within the results column, cards appear in this order:

1. **Costs comparison** – current approach vs Sighthound total hardware cost
2. **Savings card** – main callout with savings or extra cost and directional arrow
3. **Deployment details** – nodes required, percent reduction, cost per camera
4. **CTA / follow-up** – links to contact Sighthound or email support

Reasons:

- Users first see **absolute costs** ("what am I spending now vs with Sighthound?")
- Then they see **delta** (savings or extra cost), framed clearly as a difference
- Finally, they can inspect **details** and take action (CTA)

This ordering is important – do not move the savings card above the absolute costs, or it becomes easy to misread the savings number as the total cost.

### Input and state cues

The UI deliberately includes several affordances to make the state of the calculator obvious:

- A short subheader under the main title explains, in one sentence, what the calculator does and how it is used.
- A compact "Step 1 / Step 2" strip under **How this works** reinforces the flow:
  - Step 1: enter camera counts and hardware costs.
  - Step 2: review savings and deployment details.
- A small note – "Updates instantly as you type" – encourages experimentation and confirms that the tool is reactive.
- The **Total cameras** input is explicitly marked with a **Required** pill so visitors know it must be filled in before any useful results appear.
- The software cost field is labeled as **Optional** and visually tagged as such, to avoid implying it is needed for the core hardware estimate.

### Progressive disclosure (breakdown)

The cost breakdown (how we arrived at the totals) is **hidden by default** behind a "Show breakdown" toggle.

- Default state shows only high-level numbers – clear for non-technical users
- When a user clicks **Show breakdown**, we display:
  - The smart camera side: camera count × smart camera price
  - The Sighthound side: number of nodes × node price, and cameras × IP camera price (or a note that existing cameras are reused)

Purpose:

- **Clarity first:** most users just need a trustworthy summary
- **Proof second:** power users and skeptics can expand to verify every step of the math

### Reset behavior and URL parameters

The **Reset calculations** button:

- Clears the camera count
- Resets camera prices back to their defaults
- Unchecks the existing cameras and “share details” checkboxes
- Clears all calculator-related URL query parameters

Clearing URL parameters is deliberate:

- Shared calculator links store the current state in the URL (camera count and prices)
- Resetting should return to a neutral starting point, not keep stale values in the address bar
- It avoids confusion when copying links after changing scenarios

---

## 6) Tech stack and why

The calculator is intentionally simple from a technology standpoint.

- **HTML:** single-page app in `index.html`
- **CSS:** Tailwind CSS via CDN, plus minimal custom styles
- **JavaScript:**
  - Plain browser JavaScript for all interaction and calculations
  - Core math logic in `script.js` with unit tests in `script.test.js`

There is **no front-end framework** (no React, Vue, etc.) and **no build step**.

Reasons for this choice:

- **Fast load:** only a single HTML file, Tailwind CDN, and a small amount of JS
- **Easy handoff:** any web developer can understand and modify the code without learning a specific framework
- **Simple hosting:** works on any static host or even directly from the filesystem
- **Minimal dependencies:** avoids keeping a JS toolchain up to date for such a small tool

If you are considering adding a framework or bundler, treat that as a significant architectural change and get buy-in first.

## 7) Do’s and Don’ts for future changes

### Do

- **Keep the math logic centralized**
  - Pure calculation functions live in `script.js` and are covered by `script.test.js`.
  - If you change the formulas, update the tests alongside the code.
- **Preserve fixed constants unless pricing truly changes**
  - `CAMERAS_PER_NODE` and `NODE_COST` should only change when product capacity or pricing changes.
- **Keep UI copy concise and public-facing**
  - Assume anything on the page can be shown in sales decks or shared with customers.
  - Favor clear, literal language over marketing slogans.
- **Maintain URL-based state sharing**
  - The calculator persists camera count and price inputs into URL parameters.
  - When extending the app, keep this behavior intact so links remain shareable.

### Don’t

- **Don’t add SaaS, ROI, or operational cost assumptions** without explicit product/PM approval
  - The tool is intentionally hardware-only; more complex financial modeling belongs in a separate calculator.
- **Don’t change cameras-per-node logic** without validating hardware limits
  - Capacity assumptions must reflect real-world deployment guidance.
- **Don’t reorder results** in a way that makes savings look like the total cost
  - Cost comparison should stay before the savings callout.
- **Don’t introduce heavy frameworks or a complex build pipeline** without strong justification
  - Any such change should clearly pay for itself in maintainability or new capabilities.

## 8) Extensibility notes

### Safe areas to extend

These are generally low-risk changes as long as you keep the core assumptions and math intact:

- **Styling:**
  - Adjust Tailwind classes, spacing, colors, and typography.
  - Improve responsiveness while keeping the two-column structure and card ordering.
- **Copy:**
  - Clarify labels, helper text, and explanations.
  - Add more contextual text around who this is for and how to interpret results.
- **CTA behavior:**
  - Update links, add tracking parameters, or change CTA copy.
  - The checkbox that controls whether details are included in links/emails can be extended, but keep it explicit and opt-in.
- **Preset scenarios:**
  - Add buttons or links that pre-fill the form with common deployments (e.g., retail store, warehouse) using URL parameters or small helpers.

### Risky areas

Treat changes here carefully and keep tests and documentation in sync:

- **Core math:**
  - Any change to node capacity, pricing, or formulas for totals/savings.
- **Assumptions:**
  - Expanding beyond hardware-only, or changing what is assumed about existing cameras.
- **Savings labeling and sign logic:**
  - The UI intentionally distinguishes between savings and extra cost, with color and copy changes.
  - Avoid making changes that could make negative outcomes look positive or ambiguous.

## 9) How to run / edit

There is no build or server requirement.

- Open `index.html` directly in a modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Safari, Firefox).
- Edit HTML/CSS/JS in your editor of choice.
- For math changes, run the Node tests locally:
  - `node script.test.js` (using Node’s built-in `node:test` module).

All logic that affects customers runs entirely in the browser – there is no backend.

---

## 10) Final note

This calculator prioritizes **clarity, trust, and correctness** over visual flash or marketing.

- It should always be obvious what assumptions are being made.
- Numbers should be easy to sanity-check with a basic calculator.
- Negative outcomes should be shown just as honestly as positive ones.

Because this tool is often used live in sales conversations and demos, small changes to copy, math, or layout can have outsized impact on how Sighthound’s value is perceived. When in doubt, favor transparency and simplicity, and keep this README up to date with any behavior changes.

## GitHub Pages & Squarespace embedding

- Canonical repository: `https://github.com/sighthoundinc/hw-savings`
- Enable GitHub Pages for this repository:
  - In GitHub, go to **Settings → Pages**.
  - Under **Source**, choose **Deploy from branch**.
  - Select the `main` branch and `/ (root)` folder.
- Expected public URL:
  - `https://sighthoundinc.github.io/hw-savings/`
- Note: use **relative paths** for local assets (no leading `/`) because GitHub Pages serves this app from `/hw-savings/`.
  - When adding assets, prefer paths like `assets/...` instead of `/assets/...` so the app continues to work inside an `<iframe>`.

Squarespace embed example:

```html
<iframe
  src="https://sighthoundinc.github.io/hw-savings/"
  style="width: 100%; min-height: 700px; border: 0;"
  loading="lazy"
></iframe>
```

- In Squarespace, add a **Code** block and paste the `<iframe>` snippet.
- If you change the GitHub Pages settings or repository name, update the `src` URL to match.
